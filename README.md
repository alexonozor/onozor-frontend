# Onozor Frontend Application

Onozor is a question and answer forum and community with the idea of sharing quality information of all categories.

## Development server

Onozor is built with Angular version 6.0.0 with so much modularity and for scalability in mind.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
